# AMR code

This code decribes the basic version of the code used in the REF 1. It decribes the basic set of features needed to recreate and rerun the modelling work. A continuous developed version of the code is availble in the root folder.

Two main differences in this code and the code used in REF 1 is the material and fluid data. 

The fluid data used in the paper is by Trevizoli (REF 2) and the Gd material data from Bjork (REF 3). This has been replaced by fluid data calculated from REF 4 and MFT Gd data from REF 5. Using the MFT data will over predict the performance of the regenerator it is crucial to optain good Gd data.
