# AMR code

This code describes the basic version of the code used in the REF 1. The basic set of features needed to recreate and rerun the modelling work are included. A continuous developed version of the code is availble in the root folder.


Some changes are made to code used in **REF 1** because the material and fluid data is obtained from proprietary sources. The fluid data used in the paper is by Trevizoli (**REF 2**) and the Gd material data from Bjork (**REF 3**). This has been replaced by fluid data calculated from **REF 4** and MFT Gd data from **REF 5**. Using the MFT data will over predict the performance of the regenerator it is crucial to optain good Gd data.
